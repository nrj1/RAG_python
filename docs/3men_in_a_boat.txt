Jerome K. Jerome's 1889 comic novel recounts a boating holiday on the Thames undertaken by three friends—the narrator J., the pompous George, and the constantly confused Harris—along with J.'s fox terrier Montmorency. Originally intended as a serious travel guide, the book became a hilarious account of their misadventures. The trio, believing themselves afflicted with various ailments (except for housemaid's knee), decide a river trip will restore their health. Their journey from Kingston to Oxford is marked by constant comic mishaps: erecting tents in the rain, getting lost in hedge mazes, struggling with tin cans, and creating culinary disasters. Jerome intersperses the narrative with historical anecdotes about riverside locations and philosophical musings on life's absurdities. Montmorency, the dog, provides his own comedy by fighting with other animals and proving utterly useless. The humor derives from the gap between the men's self-perception as competent outdoorsmen and their actual helplessness with practical tasks. Jerome's gentle satire of Victorian masculine pride and his keen observations of everyday frustrations made the book enormously popular and enduringly funny, establishing it as a classic of English humor.

Charles Dickens's 1838 novel exposes the brutal treatment of the poor in Victorian England through young Oliver Twist's harrowing experiences. Born in a workhouse where his mother dies, Oliver endures starvation and abuse before his famous request for more gruel leads to his being sold as an apprentice. He escapes to London, where he falls in with the Artful Dodger and is taken to Fagin's den of child thieves. Oliver is forced into crime despite his innocent nature. After being wrongly accused during a pickpocketing attempt, he's rescued by the kind Mr. Brownlow, but is kidnapped back by Fagin's gang, who fear Oliver might expose them. The sinister Bill Sikes and his accomplice Nancy use Oliver in a burglary attempt. Nancy, showing unexpected compassion, tries to help Oliver but is murdered by Sikes for her betrayal. The novel's twisting plot reveals Oliver is actually from a wealthy family, and various villains receive their just punishment. Dickens uses Oliver's story to critique the Poor Laws, expose the London underworld, and argue that goodness is innate rather than determined by social class, while creating unforgettable characters.

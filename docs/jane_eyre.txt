Charlotte Brontë's 1847 masterpiece follows Jane Eyre from her oppressed childhood as an orphan through her journey to independence and love. After enduring cruelty at her aunt's home and hardship at Lowood charity school, Jane becomes governess at Thornfield Hall. There she falls in love with her employer, the brooding Mr. Rochester. Their wedding is dramatically halted when Jane discovers Rochester already has a wife—Bertha Mason, hidden in the attic due to her madness. Refusing to become his mistress despite her love, Jane flees and nearly dies on the moors before being rescued by the Rivers family, who turn out to be her cousins. She inherits a fortune and rejects a loveless marriage proposal from her cousin St. John. Hearing Rochester's supernatural call, Jane returns to find Thornfield burned and Rochester blinded and widowed after Bertha's death. They reunite as equals and marry. The novel revolutionized literature with its fierce, independent heroine who refuses to compromise her principles for convention or passion, insisting on dignity, equality, and self-respect in an age when women had few rights.

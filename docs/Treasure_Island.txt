Robert Louis Stevenson's 1883 adventure novel follows young Jim Hawkins, who discovers a treasure map in the chest of a deceased pirate staying at his family's inn. Jim shares the map with local squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey, who organize an expedition to find the treasure. They hire a crew including the charismatic one-legged cook, Long John Silver. During the voyage aboard the Hispaniola, Jim overhears Silver plotting mutiny—he's actually a pirate who has recruited most of the crew. Upon reaching the island, the group splits, with Jim's party taking refuge in a stockade while fighting off the pirates. Jim has several adventures, including meeting Ben Gunn, a marooned pirate who has already found the treasure. Through courage and quick thinking, Jim helps defeat the mutineers, though not without losses. Silver's character remains fascinatingly ambiguous—charming and treacherous by turns. The novel pioneered many pirate story conventions: treasure maps marked with X, tropical islands, parrots, and the iconic "Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum." It's a timeless tale of adventure, loyalty, and the transition from innocence to experience.
